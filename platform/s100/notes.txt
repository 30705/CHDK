S100 NOTES

- Alt shortcut: 
adjustable, default is the play button. Hold for 1/2 second for original function

- This camera is able to boot from FAT32 cards when the appropriate BOOTDISK string is written

CAMERA TODO/KNOWN ISSUES:
- value for SleepTask in kbd.c instead of hardcoded 10
- various defines in platform_camera.h needs to be checked

- 100d movie override quality seems to be working but values might be wrong (stock Canon reaches 4MB/s, CHDK quality 99 2MB/s)
- 100d movie zoom unlock works but locks the keyboard after the first zooming
- 100d jogdial is untested and needs correct rear_dial_position address in stubs_min.S
- 100d needs correct some_flag_for_af_scan in stubs_entry_2.S
- 100d address for custom power on needs to be checked in boot.c because it seems to be wrong
